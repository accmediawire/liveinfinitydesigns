                    <p class="text-center"><em>Dr. Axe is another health blogger that Iâ€™ve been following for quite some time. His style of keto, dubbed Clean Keto, seems to be the most sensible Iâ€™ve seen yet. I love how he gives options for a basic plan, intermittent fasting plan and a vegan plan. I think there might be a few others as well.&nbsp;His principles are all sound and grounded in fact with lots of testimonials to back up his claims. He gives lots of explanation for not only why you should eat Thai way but also how it works in your body.</em><br></p>
